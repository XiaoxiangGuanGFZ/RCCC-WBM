# RCCC-WBM
## Introduction
The RCCC-WBM is a simplified hydrological model, developed by the Research Center for Climate Change (RCCC), Ministry of Water Resources of China. The model estimates daily or monthly stream flow from precipitation, temperature, and pan evaporation. Its advantages include a simpler structure, fewer parameters and more flexibility. The model has been successfully applied to over 200 typical catchments in China.
## Software
this web-based application is written by R project, together with shiny package, which provides the functions of interactive operation and web deployment. 
The required packages also include:
ggplot2, shinythemes, formattables, and DT
## Application 
- lumped monthly discharge modelling
- WBM model parameter sensitivity analysis
- runoff variation attribution (effect partition of climate change and anthropogenic activities)
- sensitivity analysis of annual runoff to the changes in precipitation and air temperature
